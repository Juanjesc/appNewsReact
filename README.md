This project was made with the intention of learning React and its different hooks.

## What did I learn from this project?

- Use of **MUI**, a new library for CSS styles with React and pagination: https://mui.com/
- Use of *axios* to use data from the api: https://newsapi.org/
- Use of custom hooks, and another hooks like useContext, useState, useEffect

**Note Important:**

Due to the nature of the API, which requires a subscription to be used in production, there is no demo available as you will not see the news.
If you are interested in seeing and testing this project, you can clone this project, do first a *npm install*, and run *npm run dev*, to see the project in development mode.

You will need an API KEY which you can get by registering for free on the web: https://newsapi.org/

When you get it, go to the file *NoticiasProvider.jsx* and replace ***${import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}*** with the value of your API KEY. That's it.
